Welcome to Zend Framework 1.7.1! This is the first maintenance release in the 
Zend Framework 1.7 series. This release maintains backwards compatibility
with all Zend Framework 1.x releases.

RELEASE INFORMATION
---------------

Zend Framework 1.7.1 (12976).
Released on 2008-12-01.

SPECIAL NOTICE
--------------

Since it implements a binary protocol, the Zend_Amf component must be
aware of the processor architecture on which it is executed. Currently
Zend_Amf has been tested on machines with 32- and 64-bit Intel-based
processors. Specifically, it has not been tested on Power (i5),
PowerPC, and Sparc processors. Zend_Amf may work with these
architectures, but is not currently supported. We intend to add support
for additional archtectures in upcoming mini releases.
