		<h3>Dynamic PHP Applications The Fast and Easy Way</h3>
		<p>The first thing you might want to do is visualize your directory structures. Fat-Free gives you total control over your Web site. Organize your folders in any way that pleases you. Decide where you want to store the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>HTML templates</li>
			<li>Graphics, Flash and media files</li>
			<li>Javascript and CSS files</li>
			<li>Fat-Free import files, code libraries, and PHP includes</li>
			<li>OOP classes</li>
			<li>Database (if you plan to use an embedded DB like SQLite)</li>
			<li>Configuration files</li>
			<li>Uploads/Downloads</li>
			<li>Fonts (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For security reasons, consider relocating the <code>lib/</code> folder to a path that's not Web-accessible. If you decide to move this folder, just change the line in <code>index.php</code> containing <code>require __DIR__.'lib/base.php';</code> The <code>lib/</code> folder also contains framework plug-ins that extend F3's capabilities. You can change the default location of all plug-ins by moving the files to your desired subdirectory. Then, it's just a matter of pointing the <code>PLUGINS</code> global variable to the new location. You may delete the plug-ins that you don't need. You can always restore them later.</p>
		<p>The <code>IMPORTS</code> global variable should point to the location of Fat-Free import files, code libraries, and PHP includes. On the other hand, F3 can autoload your OOP classes for you. Just add the path to the <code>AUTOLOAD</code> variable. The rest of the above-listed items do not require configuration of a framework global variable, so you may store them anywhere.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Important</h4>
			<p>The distribution package contains a file named <code>htaccess</code>. It's saved that way in the archive because some ZIP extraction tools may not be configured to display hidden files like <code>.htaccess</code>. You should rename the file if you're using Apache.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>When you're ready to write your F3-enabled site, you can start editing the rest of the code contained in the <code>index.php</code> file that displayed this Web page. Developing PHP applications will never be the same!</p>
		<h3>PHP Dependencies</h3>
		<p>Some framework features will not be available if PHP is not configured with the modules needed by your application.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>PHP Module</th>
				<th>Installed</th>
				<th>Required by</th>
			</tr>
		<repeat group="{{@modules}}" key="{{ @mod }}" value="{{ @dep }}" counter="{{ @counter }}">
			<tr class="{{ @counter%2?'odd':'even' }}">
				<td>{{ @mod }}</td>
				<td class="{{ extension_loaded(@mod)?'pass':'fail' }}">{{ extension_loaded(@mod)?'Yes':'No' }}</td>
				<td>{{ @dep }}</td>
			</tr>
		</repeat>
		</table>
		<h3>Need Help?</h3>
		<p>Technical support is available at: <code><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fatfree/support">http://sourceforge.net/projects/fatfree/support</a></code>. If you need live support, you can talk to the development team and the rest of the Fat-Free community via IRC. We're on the FreeNode <code>#fatfree</code> channel (<code>chat.freenode.net</code>).</p>
		<p>The help file included in the distribution (<code>lib/f3.chm</code>) is at your disposal if you need to take a close look at the Fat-Free API. However, the online documentation at <code><a href="http://fatfree.sourceforge.net" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">http://fatfree.sourceforge.net</a></code> provides the latest and most comprehensive information about the framework.</p>
